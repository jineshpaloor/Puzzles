1) Find all the words in a dictionary that contain exactly five vowels (a, e, i, o and u) in ascending order.

2) Find all the words in a dictionary of length at least six that contain letters in strictly ascending alphabetical order.

These games are easy to play using regular expressions, so you should solve them without regular expressions, using only simple string manipulations. If your system doesn't provide a dictionary, you can find one at http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/mwords.html.
