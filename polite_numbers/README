A number is polite if it can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers; for instance, 7 is polite because it can be written at 3 + 4. Some numbers can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers in more than one way; for instance, 15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 7 + 8. The number of ways that a number can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers is its politeness. Any number that is a power of 2 cannot be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers; such a number has a politeness of 0, and is thus impolite.
